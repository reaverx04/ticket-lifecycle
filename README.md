To begin managing tickets, log into your agent account. Once logged in, check the **Tickets** section for any newly submitted tickets that need attention. Next, ensure that each ticket is assigned to the appropriate **Help Topic** (e.g., Business Critical Outage, Equipment Request) to ensure it is properly routed for resolution.

After categorizing the ticket, assign it to the appropriate agent or team based on the ticket's severity and set the priority level (e.g., high, medium, low). Then, provide a clear and helpful response to the user, addressing their issue. As you work through the ticket, make sure to update its status (e.g., **In Progress** or **Pending**) to keep the workflow organized and transparent.

Once the issue is resolved, update the ticket status to **Closed** to complete the process and mark the ticket as finished.
